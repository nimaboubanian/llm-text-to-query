-- TPC-H Q22: Global Sales Opportunity Query (Q22)
-- Substitution parameters: I1..I7 as 7 distinct 2-digit phone country codes (validation uses 13, 31, 23, 29, 30, 18, 17)

# Business Question:
"We are running a targeted outreach campaign and want to identify untapped customers with strong financial profiles. Focus on customers whose phone number starts with any of these seven country codes: 13, 31, 23, 29, 30, 18, or 17. Among those customers, include only the ones who have never placed a single order with us at any point in our records, and whose account balance is above the average account balance of all customers in those same seven country codes who carry a positive balance. For each country code, tell us how many such prospective customers there are and what their combined account balances total. Present the results in ascending order by country code."
