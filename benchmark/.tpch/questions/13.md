-- TPC-H Q13: Customer Distribution Query (Q13)
-- Substitution parameters: WORD1 in [special, pending, unusual, express], WORD2 in [packages, requests, accounts, deposits] (validation uses WORD1 = 'special', WORD2 = 'requests')

# Business Question:
"We want to understand the full distribution of our customer base by how active they are as buyers. For every customer — including those who have never placed a single order — how many orders do they have on record, excluding any orders whose notes contain the phrase "special requests"? Once you have that per-customer order count, group all customers by that count and tell us how many customers fall into each group. Show the groups from the most populated to the least, and within ties, show the higher order counts first."
