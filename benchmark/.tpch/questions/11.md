-- TPC-H Q11: Important Stock Identification Query (Q11)
-- Substitution parameters: NATION from nation list, FRACTION = 0.0001/SF (validation uses NATION = 'GERMANY', FRACTION = 0.0001)

# Business Question:
"We want to identify which stocked parts held by German suppliers are truly worth focusing on. Scanning across all parts currently stocked by suppliers in Germany, which parts individually account for a significant share — more than 0.01% — of the total inventory value held by all German suppliers combined? For each such part, show its part number and its total stocked value (supply cost multiplied by available quantity, summed across all German suppliers carrying it), ranked from the highest value to the lowest."
