-- TPC-H Q17: Small-Quantity-Order Revenue Query (Q17)
-- Substitution parameters: BRAND in [Brand#11..Brand#55], CONTAINER as 2-syllable container string (validation uses BRAND = 'Brand#23', CONTAINER = 'MED BOX')

# Business Question:
"We are considering a policy change to stop accepting very small quantity orders for our Brand#23 parts that ship in Med Box containers, in order to reduce processing overhead and concentrate our sales effort on larger shipments. For that specific brand and container combination, first determine the typical order quantity of each individual part across all orders in our database. Then, if we had refused any order line where the quantity ordered was below 20% of that part's own typical quantity, how much gross revenue — before any discounts — would we have forfeited on average each year over our 7-year record? Give us a single average annual figure."
