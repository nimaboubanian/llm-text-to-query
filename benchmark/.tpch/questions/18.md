-- TPC-H Q18: Large Volume Customer Query (Q18)
-- Substitution parameter: QUANTITY in [312..315] (validation uses QUANTITY = 300)

# Business Question:
"We want to identify and prioritize our highest-volume buyers for a special loyalty programme. Find the top 100 customers who have ever placed an exceptionally large order — specifically, any single order where the combined quantity of all items in that order exceeded 300 units in total. For each such order, list the customer's name, their customer ID, the order ID, the order date, the order's total price on record, and the total quantity of all items in that order. Show the most valuable orders first by total price, with ties broken by the earliest order date."
