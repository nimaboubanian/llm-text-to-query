-- TPC-H Q7: Volume Shipping Query (Q7)
-- Substitution parameters: NATION1 and NATION2 from nation list (validation uses NATION1 = 'FRANCE', NATION2 = 'GERMANY')

# Business Question:
"We are reviewing our shipping contracts between France and Germany and need to understand the trade volume flowing in both directions. For each year in 1995 and 1996, how much gross discounted revenue was generated from shipments where a French supplier shipped to a German customer, and separately, where a German supplier shipped to a French customer? For each direction of trade and each year, show the supplier nation, the customer nation, the year, and the total revenue — calculated as the sum of each line item's extended price after applying its discount. Present the results sorted by supplier nation, then customer nation, then year, all ascending."
