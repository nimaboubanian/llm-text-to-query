"We are evaluating whether to establish local distribution centers across the Asia region. For the year 1994, which Asian nations generated revenue from orders where both the customer and the fulfilling supplier were located in the same nation? For each such nation, show the total revenue — calculated as the sum of each line item's extended price after applying its discount — and rank the nations from highest to lowest revenue."
