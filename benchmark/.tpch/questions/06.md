-- TPC-H Q6: Forecasting Revenue Change Query (Q6)
-- Substitution parameters: DATE in [1993..1997], DISCOUNT in [0.02..0.09], QUANTITY in [24..25] (validation uses DATE = '1994-01-01', DISCOUNT = 0.06, QUANTITY = 24)

# Business Question:
"If we had eliminated all 6% discounts during the year 1994 — but only for line items with a quantity strictly below 24 — how much additional revenue would we have collected? Please give a single total figure representing the foregone revenue from those qualifying discounted line items."
