-- Substitution parameter: COLOR from part name color list (validation uses COLOR = 'green')

# Business Question:
"We need a full profit breakdown for all parts whose name contains the word "green," across every nation and every year on record. For each combination of supplier nation and order year, what was the total profit generated — defined as the revenue collected from each line item (extended price after discount) minus the supply cost paid to the supplier for the quantity ordered? List the nations alphabetically, and within each nation show the most recent years first."
