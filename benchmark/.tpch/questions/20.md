# Business Question:
"We are preparing a promotional offer targeting Canadian suppliers who appear to be sitting on excess inventory and may be motivated to offer discounted pricing. Identify all suppliers based in Canada whose current available stock of any forest-named part — that is, any part whose name begins with "forest" — exceeds 50% of the total quantity of that same part that they personally shipped during the year 1994. List each qualifying supplier's name and address, sorted alphabetically by supplier name."
