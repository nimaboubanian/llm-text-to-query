-- TPC-H Q21: Suppliers Who Kept Orders Waiting Query (Q21)
-- Substitution parameter: NATION randomly selected from NNAME list (validation uses NATION = 'SAUDI ARABIA')

# Business Question:
"We need to audit delivery accountability among our Saudi Arabian suppliers and flag those who have a track record of being the sole cause of delays on otherwise completed orders. For each supplier based in Saudi Arabia, count the number of times they were the only party on a fully fulfilled multi-supplier order who failed to get their items to the customer by the agreed commit date — meaning the order itself was fully closed, at least one other supplier participated in the same order and managed to deliver on time, but this particular supplier's items arrived after their committed delivery date. Report the top 100 such suppliers, showing their name and their count of incidents, ranked from the most delays to the fewest, with ties broken alphabetically by supplier name."
