-- TPC-H Q12: Shipping Modes and Order Priority Query (Q12)
-- Substitution parameters: SHIPMODE1, SHIPMODE2 from modes list, DATE in [1993..1997] (validation uses SHIPMODE1 = 'MAIL', SHIPMODE2 = 'SHIP', DATE = '1994-01-01')

# Business Question:
"We are concerned that using cheaper shipping modes like Mail and Ship may be causing late deliveries that hurt our most critical customers. For all line items received during 1994 via Mail or Ship — specifically those that arrived after their committed delivery date despite having been dispatched before that committed date — how many belonged to urgent or high priority orders, and how many belonged to orders of any other priority? Show one row per shipping mode, with each mode's count of late high-priority line items and late low-priority line items, sorted alphabetically by shipping mode."
