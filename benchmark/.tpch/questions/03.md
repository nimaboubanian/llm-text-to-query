-- TPC-H Q3: Shipping Priority Query (Q3)
-- Substitution parameters: SEGMENT in [segment list], DATE in [1995-03-01..1995-03-31] (validation uses SEGMENT = 'BUILDING', DATE = '1995-03-15')

# Business Question:
"Among all orders placed by customers in the "Building" market segment that had not yet been shipped as of March 15, 1995, which 10 orders represent the greatest potential revenue? For each of those top 10 unshipped orders, show the order key, the total potential revenue — calculated as the sum of each line item's extended price after applying its discount — the order date, and the shipping priority. Present the results sorted from highest to lowest potential revenue, and for any ties in revenue, show the earlier order date first."
