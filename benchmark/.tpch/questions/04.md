-- TPC-H Q4: Order Priority Checking Query (Q4)
-- Substitution parameter: DATE in [1993-01-01..1997-10-01] (validation uses DATE = '1993-07-01')

# Business Question:
"How well is our order priority system performing for the third quarter of 1993 (July through September)? For all orders placed during that period where at least one item arrived at the customer later than its originally committed delivery date, how many such orders fall under each order priority level? Please list each priority level alongside its count of late-delivery orders, sorted in ascending order by priority."
