-- TPC-H Q2: Minimum Cost Supplier Query (Q2)
-- Substitution parameters: SIZE in [1..50], TYPE from type syllable list, REGION from region list (validation uses SIZE = 15, TYPE = 'BRASS', REGION = 'EUROPE')

# Business Question:
"We need to identify the best sourcing options for size-15 brass parts within the Europe region. For each such part, which supplier — located in Europe — can provide it at the minimum supply cost? If multiple suppliers in Europe offer the same lowest cost for the same part, show the top 100 results ranked by the supplier's account balance from highest to lowest. For every matching part-supplier combination, please include the supplier's account balance, name, and nation; the part number and its manufacturer; and the supplier's address, phone number, and any comment notes. Sort the results primarily by account balance descending, then by nation name, supplier name, and part number."
