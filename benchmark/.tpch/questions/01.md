-- TPC-H Q1: Pricing Summary Report Query (Q1)
-- Substitution parameter: DELTA in [60..120] (validation uses DELTA = 90)

# Business Question:
"Can you produce a full pricing summary report for all line items that were shipped on or before 90 days before December 1, 1998? For each combination of return flag and line status, I need to see the total quantity shipped, the total base price (before any discounts), the total discounted price (after applying line-level discounts), and the total charged amount (after both discounts and taxes). Additionally, include the average quantity, average extended price, and average discount per line item, along with a count of how many line items fall into each group. The results should be sorted in ascending order by return flag and then by line status."
