-- TPC-H Q16: Parts/Supplier Relationship Query (Q16)
-- Substitution parameters: BRAND in [Brand#11..Brand#55], TYPE as 2-syllable prefix, SIZE1..SIZE8 as 8 distinct values in [1..50] (validation uses BRAND = 'Brand#45', TYPE = 'MEDIUM POLISHED', SIZES = {49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9})

# Business Question:
"A customer has come to us with very specific part requirements: they need parts available in any of these eight sizes — 3, 9, 14, 19, 23, 36, 45, or 49 — but the parts must not belong to our Brand#45 line, and must not be of the Medium Polished type. On top of that, we need to exclude any supplier who has complaints on record at the Better Business Bureau. For every distinct combination of brand, type, and size that meets these criteria, how many different qualified suppliers can fulfil the order? Show the results starting with the combinations that have the most supplier options, breaking ties by brand, then type, then size."
