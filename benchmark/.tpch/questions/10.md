# Business Question:
"Which 20 customers caused us the greatest revenue loss through part returns during the fourth quarter of 1993 (October through December)? For each of those top 20 customers, show their customer ID, name, and the total lost revenue — calculated as the sum of extended price after discount for all returned line items from that period. Also include each customer's account balance, their nation, address, phone number, and any comment notes. Rank them from the highest lost revenue to the lowest."
