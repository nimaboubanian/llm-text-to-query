-- TPC-H Q14: Promotion Effect Query (Q14)
-- Substitution parameter: DATE as first day of a month in [1993..1997] (validation uses DATE = '1995-09-01')

# Business Question:
"We ran a promotional campaign in September 1995. Looking only at parts that were actually shipped during that month, what percentage of the total revenue — calculated as extended price after discount — came from parts classified as promotional? Give us a single percentage figure so we can gauge how well the promotion resonated in the market."
