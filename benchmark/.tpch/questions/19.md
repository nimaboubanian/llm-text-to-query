-- TPC-H Q19: Discounted Revenue Query (Q19)
-- Substitution parameters: QUANTITY1 in [1..10], QUANTITY2 in [10..20], QUANTITY3 in [20..30], BRAND1/BRAND2/BRAND3 as Brand#MN (validation uses QUANTITY1=1, QUANTITY2=10, QUANTITY3=20, BRAND1='Brand#12', BRAND2='Brand#23', BRAND3='Brand#34')

# Business Question:
"We need to calculate the total gross discounted revenue generated from air shipments that were delivered in person, across three specific product tiers we are currently evaluating. Include a line item only if it matches one of these three profiles exactly:
- Tier 1: Brand#12, small packaging (any of: SM CASE, SM BOX, SM PACK, SM PKG), sizes 1 through 5, with an ordered quantity between 1 and 11 units;
- Tier 2: Brand#23, medium packaging (any of: MED BAG, MED BOX, MED PKG, MED PACK), sizes 1 through 10, with an ordered quantity between 10 and 20 units;
- Tier 3: Brand#34, large packaging (any of: LG CASE, LG BOX, LG PACK, LG PKG), sizes 1 through 15, with an ordered quantity between 20 and 30 units.
Across all three tiers, count only items shipped via Air or Air Reg and handed directly to the customer in person. Return the combined revenue — defined as extended price after discount — as a single total figure."
